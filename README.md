# vhdl
A collection of my solutions to numerous lab problems in the Vivado Hardware Description Language(VHDL).

This project consists primarily of [GHDL](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/index.html) based sources, though technically speaking they should be directly importable into  
the AMD Xilinx Vivado suite of software without any changes.

# Building
